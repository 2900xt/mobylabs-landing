If you've ever tried to have a conversation in a crowded, noisy room, you understand the frustration of being drowned out by background sound. Now imagine that your life depends on being heard—that finding food, navigating, and connecting with family all require successful communication through sound. This is the reality for whales in our increasingly noisy oceans.

Ocean noise pollution is one of the most pervasive yet least visible threats facing marine life today. While we can see plastic pollution and oil spills, underwater noise remains largely out of sight and out of mind. But for whales, which evolved in a relatively quiet ocean and depend on sound for survival, the rising volume of human activity is creating an acoustic crisis.

## The Ocean Was Once Quiet

For millions of years, the ocean's soundscape was dominated by natural sources: waves, rain, earthquakes, ice movements, and the sounds of marine life itself. Whales evolved in this environment, developing sophisticated acoustic abilities to communicate, navigate, find prey, and avoid predators.

Then, in just over a century, humans fundamentally changed the ocean's acoustic environment. The introduction of motorized ships, underwater construction, seismic surveys, sonar, and other technologies has filled the ocean with anthropogenic (human-made) noise.

Studies comparing ocean noise levels from the 1960s to today show dramatic increases—in some frequency ranges, ocean noise has roughly doubled every decade. This means the ocean is now 10-100 times louder than it was just 50 years ago, depending on location and frequency.

## Sources of Ocean Noise Pollution

### Commercial Shipping

The largest contributor to ocean noise pollution is the global shipping fleet. Thousands of cargo ships, tankers, and container vessels traverse the world's oceans, their engines and propellers generating continuous low-frequency noise.

Ship noise primarily falls in the same frequency range (10-200 Hz) that many large whales use for communication. A single large container ship can be heard hundreds of miles away by whales. In heavily trafficked areas, the cumulative noise from multiple vessels creates a constant roar.

The problem has grown worse as global shipping volume has increased and ships have gotten larger and faster. Modern container ships can generate noise levels over 190 decibels underwater—roughly equivalent to a rocket launch in air.

### Seismic Surveys

Energy companies use seismic airguns to search for oil and gas deposits beneath the seafloor. These devices produce some of the loudest human-made sounds in the ocean—over 250 decibels at the source.

Every 10-15 seconds, the airguns fire, creating explosive blasts that propagate through the water and into the seafloor. A single seismic survey can continue for weeks or months, affecting areas spanning thousands of square miles.

These intense sounds can mask whale calls, disrupt feeding and migration, and in extreme cases, cause physical injury or death. Multiple studies have documented whales fleeing from seismic survey areas.

### Military Sonar

Naval sonar systems, particularly mid-frequency active sonar used to detect submarines, produce extremely loud pulses of sound. These systems have been linked to mass strandings of beaked whales and other species.

While military use represents a smaller portion of overall ocean noise than shipping, the intensity of sonar signals can be devastating to whales in the immediate vicinity.

### Underwater Construction

Pile driving for offshore wind farms, bridges, docks, and other construction creates percussive noise that can travel great distances underwater. A single pile-driving strike can exceed 200 decibels.

While often more localized than shipping noise, construction can make critical habitats temporarily uninhabitable for sensitive species, disrupting feeding, breeding, or migration.

### Recreational Vessels

In coastal areas, the cumulative noise from pleasure boats, jet skis, and other recreational craft can significantly raise local noise levels, particularly during peak seasons. While individual boats may not be as loud as commercial ships, their numbers and unpredictable movements can create chronic disturbance.

## How Noise Affects Whales

### Masking Communication

Whales use sound to communicate across distances that would be impossible with visual signals. Male humpbacks sing complex songs to attract mates and establish territories. Mother whales and calves maintain contact through calls. Whales coordinate feeding and traveling through vocalizations.

When background noise levels rise, these calls become harder to hear—a phenomenon called masking. Imagine trying to hear someone whisper across a room while someone runs a chainsaw.

Masking reduces the distance over which whale calls can be heard. In pre-industrial oceans, a blue whale call might be heard 1,000 miles away. Today, in noisy shipping lanes, that same call might only travel 100 miles—a 90% reduction in communication range.

This forces whales to either call louder (which costs energy), call more frequently (which also costs energy), or accept reduced communication ranges. For species already in decline, any factor that reduces reproductive success or increases energy expenditure can have population-level consequences.

### Disrupted Foraging and Navigation

Many toothed whales use echolocation to find prey and navigate. Background noise can interfere with their ability to interpret returning echoes, making hunting more difficult and energy-expensive.

Some whale species may also use acoustic cues from the environment to navigate during migration—listening for coastal features, currents, or even the sounds of biological productivity. High noise levels could disrupt these navigational abilities.

Studies have shown that whales alter their diving behavior, feeding patterns, and movement in response to noise, suggesting that acoustic disturbance affects their ability to carry out essential behaviors efficiently.

### Stress Responses

Chronic noise exposure creates physiological stress in whales. Studies measuring stress hormones in whale feces have found elevated levels corresponding to increased shipping traffic.

This stress response has tangible consequences: increased energy expenditure, suppressed immune function, reduced reproductive success, and altered behavior patterns. Over time, chronic stress can affect population health and recovery rates.

### Physical Injury

At extreme levels, noise can cause direct physical harm. Very loud sounds can damage whale hearing, cause tissue damage, and even lead to death. Mass strandings of beaked whales following naval sonar exercises demonstrate the potential for acoustic trauma.

Even at lower levels, temporary hearing threshold shifts (temporary deafness) can occur, leaving whales vulnerable to ship strikes or unable to communicate for hours or days.

### Behavioral Changes

Whales often react to noise by changing their behavior: swimming away from the source, altering dive patterns, stopping feeding or socializing, or falling silent. While these might seem like minor adaptations, they have energy costs and opportunity costs.

A whale that stops feeding to avoid noise must either feed elsewhere (expending energy to travel) or go hungry. A mother and calf separated by noise may expend considerable energy reuniting. These small costs add up over time.

## Particularly Vulnerable Species

### North Atlantic Right Whales

Already critically endangered with fewer than 350 individuals, right whales face severe noise impacts. They call at frequencies particularly affected by shipping noise, and much of their range overlaps with busy shipping lanes.

Their communication range has been reduced by up to 90% in some areas, potentially affecting their ability to find mates and maintain social bonds.

### Beaked Whales

These deep-diving whales are particularly sensitive to mid-frequency sonar. Multiple mass strandings have occurred following naval exercises, with necropsies revealing acoustic trauma.

Beaked whales rely heavily on echolocation for deep-sea foraging, making them especially vulnerable to acoustic disruption.

### Blue Whales

As the largest animals on Earth, blue whales produce some of the lowest-frequency and loudest calls in nature, designed to travel across ocean basins. However, these calls overlap almost perfectly with the frequency range of ship noise.

Blue whales have been documented calling louder in response to shipping noise—an energetically expensive adaptation that may not fully compensate for increased background noise levels.

## Solutions and Hope

The good news is that noise pollution is reversible. Unlike chemical pollution or plastic that persists in the environment, noise stops as soon as the source stops. This means interventions can have immediate benefits.

### Vessel Speed Reduction

Slowing ships reduces noise significantly. A ship traveling at 10 knots produces much less noise than the same ship at 20 knots. This simple measure also reduces ship strike risk and fuel consumption.

Several voluntary and mandatory slow-speed zones have been implemented in whale-critical areas, with measurable reductions in underwater noise levels.

### Quieter Ship Design

Engineering solutions can make ships quieter: improved propeller designs, better engine mounting, hull modifications, and advanced propulsion systems. While retrofitting existing vessels is challenging, new builds can incorporate quieter technologies.

Some shipping companies are already investing in quieter vessels, both for environmental benefits and because quieter operation often correlates with better fuel efficiency.

### Routing and Timing

Moving shipping lanes away from critical whale habitats or timing construction activities to avoid sensitive periods (like breeding or calving seasons) can reduce impacts without eliminating activities.

Dynamic routing based on real-time whale detection—using technology like MobyGlobal's acoustic monitoring—allows vessels to avoid whales when and where they're present, rather than imposing permanent restrictions.

### Better Regulations

Expanding quiet zones, implementing noise limits for new ships, requiring noise impact assessments for construction projects, and enforcing existing regulations can all help protect whales from excessive noise.

International cooperation through organizations like the International Maritime Organization can establish global standards for ship noise reduction.

### Acoustic Monitoring

Real-time acoustic monitoring serves dual purposes: detecting whales to prevent ship strikes and tracking noise levels to understand and mitigate impacts. This technology provides the data needed to make informed management decisions.

By mapping ocean noise levels and whale presence simultaneously, we can identify high-impact areas requiring intervention and measure the effectiveness of noise reduction measures.

## Individual Actions

Even if you don't operate a ship, you can help:

- **Support quieter shipping**: Advocate for regulations requiring quieter vessels and slower speeds in sensitive areas
- **Reduce consumption**: Less global shipping demand means fewer ships and less noise
- **Spread awareness**: Many people don't realize ocean noise pollution exists—education is the first step
- **Support research and conservation**: Organizations working on this issue need funding and public support
- **Participate in citizen science**: Some programs allow recreational boaters to collect acoustic data

## A Call for Quieter Oceans

Whales have been calling out in our oceans for millions of years. Only recently have their voices been drowned out by the sounds of human activity. We have the technology and knowledge to quiet our oceans—what we need is the will to act.

Every decibel we reduce is a gift to whales: a chance to hear their calves, find their food, navigate their ancient migration routes, and sing their songs. The ocean's acoustic environment is a shared resource, and whales need it to survive.

By recognizing noise pollution as a serious threat and implementing proven solutions, we can restore some of the acoustic clarity that whales depend on. The ocean will never be as quiet as it once was, but it can be quiet enough for whales to thrive.

Listen to the ocean. The whales are still calling. We just need to turn down the volume so they can hear each other again.
